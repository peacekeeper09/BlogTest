            <h3>Apple - ios 16.4 beta 3 </h3>
            
            <p>You can always refer to <a class="1st" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-16_4-release-notes">apple release notes.</a> Considering that it is too lenghty and some users might not find some provided information necessary, here are some key features mentioned below!</p>
         <p class="bold">1) Apple is making it harder for people to install unfinished versions of their software (called beta versions) from websites or profiles that aren't controlled by Apple. Now, you'll need to prove that you're part of Apple's beta program to install these versions. Also, with iOS 16.4, you'll be able to use a different Apple ID for beta versions than the one you use for everything else on your device.</p>
         <p class="bold">2) The Apple Pencil can now detect how it's tilted (tilt support) and the direction it's pointing (azimuth support) when you hover it over your device's screen, which can make your drawings and writing look more realistic and natural.</p> 
        <p class="bold">3) The keyboard on your device is getting updated in a few ways. First, it will have new emojis that you can use. Also, if you use the Korean keyboard, autocorrect will be turned on by default for you to test and give feedback. The Ukrainian keyboard will now suggest words as you type, and the keyboards for Gujarati, Punjabi, and Urdu will be able to convert English letters to those languages. Finally, new keyboard options are available for Choctaw and Chickasaw languages.</p>
        <p class="bold">4) New Podcast Application.</p>  
        <p class="bold">5) New wallet widget that will enchance your order tracking experience.</p>  
        <p class="bold">6) T-Mobile users now have access to 5G networks that work on their own (called "standalone" support), which can provide faster internet speeds in areas where it's available.
